(Bug #1 "Restart kernel kills but relaunch fails" — fixed & confirmed
2026-07-08, moved to `archive/bugs-fixed.md`.)

(Bug #2 "Running a cell with a dead kernel does not start it" — fixed &
confirmed 2026-07-10, moved to `archive/bugs-fixed.md`.)

(Bug #3 "Interrupt does not stop a running cell" — fixed & confirmed 2026-07-10
via the OS-level interrupt; a pure-Python loop interrupts immediately. Immediate
interrupt of C-blocking calls like `time.sleep` on Windows remains a backlog
item. Moved to `archive/bugs-fixed.md`.)

(Bug #4 "More options button opens nothing" — fixed & confirmed 2026-07-08
via phase 4's popover menu; moved to `archive/bugs-fixed.md`.)

(Bug #5 "Output ... button does nothing" — fixed & confirmed 2026-07-08 via
phase 4's output menu; moved to `archive/bugs-fixed.md`.)

## 6. Native kernel launch is flaky on Windows (os error 10054)

- **Status:** fix attempted - untested
- **Symptom:** "Kernel Error: cell could not be executed — the kernel failed
  to launch: handling failed for recv task: control recv: Codec Error: An
  existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host. (os error
  10054)"
- **Analysis:** Message chain fully traced: control-socket read failure
  (`kernels/mod.rs:144-147`) → recv task bails → `kernel_errored`
  (`mod.rs:190-197`) → `Kernel::ErroredLaunch` → error rendered by
  `execute_cell`/`show_kernel_error`. Root cause: the native launch path
  (`native_kernel.rs:112-255`) connects to the kernel's sockets immediately
  after spawn with no readiness wait and no premature-exit check — the WSL
  path (`wsl_kernel.rs:290-323`) does both (2s wait + `try_status()` +
  stderr capture). Also aggravated by the restart races in bug #1.
- **Fix attempted:** Native kernel launch now waits 500ms after spawning and
  checks for premature process exit, reporting the kernel's stderr in the
  error message (mirrors the WSL path). Connection files are unique per
  launch so a dying old kernel can no longer delete the new kernel's file.
  The stale-message-task fix under bug #1 also removes the main source of
  spurious `ErroredLaunch` states after restarts. A fixed sleep is a partial
  measure — a kernel_info/heartbeat readiness handshake is a possible
  follow-up if 10054 persists (noted in backlog).
- **Tested:** no — needs user confirmation on Windows

## 7. Restart does not clear per-execution state

- **Status:** fix attempted - untested
- **Symptom:** (found in code review, not user-reported) After a restart,
  stale `msg_id → CellId` entries linger in `execution_requests`; incoming
  messages could be routed to old cells.
- **Analysis:** `restart_kernel` doesn't clear `self.execution_requests`;
  `change_kernel` does (`notebook_ui.rs:486`).
- **Fix attempted:** `restart_kernel` now clears `execution_requests` (and
  stops executing-cell spinners); `kernel_errored`/`kernel_exited` clear it
  too.
- **Tested:** no — needs user confirmation

(Bug #8 "Clean kernel exit leaves stale RunningKernel state" — fixed &
confirmed 2026-07-08, moved to `archive/bugs-fixed.md`.)

## 9. Notebook never reports itself dirty

- **Status:** open
- **Symptom:** (found in code review) Structural/metadata changes (add/move
  cells, outputs) don't mark the notebook modified, so closing may not
  prompt to save.
- **Analysis:** `NotebookItem::is_dirty` (the ProjectItem impl) is hardcoded
  `false` with a TODO (`notebook_ui.rs:1921-1924`). NOTE (phase 4): the
  workspace `Item::is_dirty` for `NotebookEditor` (`notebook_ui.rs:2200`)
  already returns `has_structural_changes() || has_content_changes()`, so
  cell add/delete/move/convert and edits DO mark the tab dirty and prompt on
  close. The remaining `NotebookItem::is_dirty` stub may be dead/irrelevant —
  confirm whether anything consults it before "fixing" it.
- **Fix attempted:** none
- **Tested:** n/a

(Bug #10 "Kernel picker does not accept Enter" — fixed & confirmed 2026-07-08
via the NotebookCellEditor keymap scoping; moved to `archive/bugs-fixed.md`.)

(Bug #11 "Kernel-select prompt: cell state on dismiss vs. select" — fixed &
confirmed 2026-07-08, moved to `archive/bugs-fixed.md`.)

## 12. "Clear all outputs" sometimes needed several presses

- **Status:** open (not reproduced)
- **Symptom:** (user 2026-07-08) One instance where "Clear all outputs" had to
  be pressed ~5 times before it worked. Not reproducible so far.
- **Analysis:** none yet. Low-priority note; investigate only if it recurs.
- **Fix attempted:** none
- **Tested:** n/a

(Bug #13 "After adding a cell with `a`/`b`, Enter won't enter edit mode" —
fixed & confirmed 2026-07-10 (`a`/`b` now stay in command mode); moved to
`archive/bugs-fixed.md`. The broader full-focus-loss edge remains as bug #15.)

## 15. Notebook keyboard shortcuts get stuck (focus/mode desync)

- **Status:** fix attempted - untested
- **Symptom:** (user 2026-07-08) Intermittently, command-mode shortcuts
  (delete, add, convert, copy/paste, undo) stop firing. In the stuck state
  there is NO cursor and NO characters appear (so it is NOT edit mode), and
  pressing Escape does not recover it. Recovery required selecting another
  cell, pressing Escape, navigating back, then the shortcut worked. Also seen:
  `b` sometimes doesn't even select/focus the new cell (stays on the old one),
  other times it does. So it's a focus/mode desync, not a specific action bug —
  it's very likely the underlying cause of the "undo/copy/paste not working"
  reports too (the `z`/`c`/`v` keys simply don't dispatch when stuck).
- **Analysis:** command-mode keybindings require BOTH `notebook_mode == command`
  AND the notebook (or a descendant) focused. These can desync: `select_cell_by_id`
  sets `Edit` on any editor focus, and focus can be lost entirely (e.g. after
  clicking toolbar buttons / popovers) with nothing bringing it back — Escape
  is only bound in the notebook contexts, so if focus is fully off the notebook
  it can't recover. Needs runtime debugging to pin the exact focus-loss
  trigger(s).
- **Fix attempted (2026-07-08), partial/mitigations:**
  1. `cx.on_focus` on the notebook root handle → force `notebook_mode = Command`
     whenever the notebook itself gains focus, keeping mode synced to focus.
  2. `a`/`b`/+ now stay in command mode (bug #13) so adding a cell no longer
     drops you into edit unexpectedly.
  3. Bound Escape → `EnterCommandMode` in the base `NotebookEditor` context
     (not just edit mode) as a recovery path — works whenever the notebook is
     still in the focus chain.
  These may not fully fix the "focus fully lost" case (where nothing in the
  notebook is focused); that likely needs returning focus to the notebook after
  toolbar-button / popover interactions. Kept OPEN.
- **Update (user 2026-07-09):** "Your fix on focus seems to have worked, mark
  that down but keep it open as an ongoing observation." The on_focus mode-sync
  mitigation appears effective; keeping the bug OPEN as an ongoing observation
  in case the "focus fully lost" edge recurs. If it does, capture the exact
  action that dropped focus (the reporter wasn't sure of the trigger this time).
- **Tested:** partially — the on_focus fix seems to work; kept open as an
  ongoing observation for the rarer full-focus-loss case.

## 14. Saving overwrites external changes without warning

- **Status:** open
- **Symptom:** (user 2026-07-08) If the .ipynb changed on disk while open in
  Zed and you have unsaved notebook changes, saving from Zed silently
  overwrites the on-disk (external) changes with no warning/confirmation.
- **Analysis:** Phase 9 surfaces the conflict on the RELOAD side (a toast when
  the file changes on disk under unsaved changes) but the SAVE side
  (`Item::save`, `notebook_ui.rs`) unconditionally `fs.atomic_write`s. It needs
  a save-time conflict check: before writing, compare the on-disk content (or
  the retained buffer's `has_conflict` / mtime) against what we loaded, and if
  it changed, prompt to overwrite / cancel / diff. Requires a confirm dialog,
  so it's its own chunk of work. Data-loss risk → medium-high.
- **Fix attempted (2026-07-11, phase 14):** a `disk_changed_externally` flag is
  set when the external-change conflict is detected (the phase-9 toast path);
  while set, `Item::save` shows an Overwrite/Cancel prompt and only writes on
  Overwrite. Flag clears on reload or confirmed overwrite. A Reload button on
  the conflict toast + a "Reload Notebook" command were added alongside.
- **Tested:** no — needs user confirmation (see phase 14 checklist)

## 16. Queued cell output misrouted when a run spans kernel selection/launch

- **Status:** open (needs runtime instrumentation)
- **Symptom:** (user 2026-07-10) With no kernel selected, the user ran cells 1
  and 2 (which brought up the kernel picker), selected a kernel, then ran cell
  3. Cells 1 and 2 ran, cell 2 errored — but cell 2's error output appeared in
  **cell 3's** output area, not cell 2's. Does NOT reproduce when the kernel is
  already selected before running; only when the queued cells straddle the
  kernel selection/launch boundary. User's hunch: "3 was queued before 1 had
  completed."
- **Analysis so far (what has been RULED OUT):**
  - Routing is by `parent_header.msg_id → execution_requests[msg_id] → cell`
    (`notebook_ui.rs` `route`), and each `ExecuteRequest.into()` gets a UNIQUE
    `msg_id` (jupyter-protocol `JupyterMessage::new` → `Uuid::new_v4()`), so a
    simple msg_id collision is not the cause.
  - The queued-cell flush (`launch_kernel` ready branch:
    `for cell_id in take(pending_executions) { execute_cell(cell_id) }`) sends
    in order and records `execution_requests.insert(msg_id, cell_id)` per
    iteration, so the recorded mapping looks correct on paper.
  - `promote_awaiting_cells` preserves order; the manually-run cell 3 is
    appended after, so the drain order is [1, 2, 3].
  - Not the batch/`run_queue` path (these were individual runs, so
    `active_run_cell` is None).
  - NOTE anomaly: `JupyterMessage::new` also generates a fresh `session` id PER
    message when there is no parent, so every execute request uses a DIFFERENT
    session. Unusual (normally one session per client); shouldn't cross-wire by
    msg_id, but worth checking whether iopub attribution is affected.
- **Leading remaining hypotheses:** (a) a race between `route()` handling
  incoming iopub messages and `execution_requests` being mutated during the
  rapid back-to-back flush; (b) the kernel attaching the wrong parent under the
  per-message-session quirk; (c) a display/index issue where the output lands
  on the cell at a stale index. Needs targeted logging of the actual
  `msg_id ↔ cell_id` map and the misrouted error's `parent_header` at runtime.
- **Fix attempted:** none directly (the obvious cause is ruled out; a
  speculative fix would be premature). HOWEVER, phase 17 (2026-07-11) made two
  changes to the same span-kernel-selection path that plausibly resolve or at
  least reshape this: (1) the focus-grab that dismissed the kernel picker and
  DROPPED awaiting cells is gone — cells queued before/after selection now
  survive in order; (2) outputs are now cleared and attributed at each cell's
  own `execute_input`, so an output can no longer land on a cell whose state
  was stale from the queue-time clear. Debug logging was added around
  promote/dismiss/flush (`log::debug`, scope `repl`) to capture the queue
  contents if it recurs.
- **Tested:** no — re-test the original repro (queue 2 cells pre-selection,
  1 post, second cell errors) after phase 17 lands.

## 17. One-off shift-enter focus jump on a brand-new notebook

- **Status:** open (not reproduced)
- **Symptom:** (user 2026-07-11) On the FIRST run in a freshly-created notebook:
  added an import line to the first cell, pressed shift-enter to execute. It
  advanced down, created a new cell (expected, since it was the last cell), then
  jumped focus BACK to the first cell. Could not recreate; a second attempt
  behaved normally.
- **Analysis:** likely a focus/selection race specific to the just-created
  single-cell notebook — `run_and_advance`'s last-cell branch does
  `add_code_block` (which selects the new cell in command mode via
  `add_code_cell_at` → `enter_command_mode`) and then `enter_command_mode`
  again; combined with the async execute/notify and the `cx.on_focus` mode-sync
  handler, selection may momentarily bounce. Overlaps with the phase-11 /
  bug #15 focus work. Watch for recurrence; capture the cell count and whether
  a kernel was attached if it happens again.
- **Fix attempted:** none
- **Tested:** n/a

## 18. Executing a notebook doesn't mark it dirty (external save discards runs)

- **Status:** open
- **Symptom:** (user 2026-07-11) Opened the same .ipynb in Zed and VS Code.
  In Zed, executed the first 3 cells but did NOT change any cell content. Edited
  the file in VS Code and saved. Zed auto-reloaded and LOST the execution
  state, because with no content edits Zed didn't consider itself dirty and so
  treated the disk version as authoritative. A notebook whose execution
  outputs / counts have changed should count as modified (VS Code stores
  execution metadata in the JSON, so the in-memory and on-disk versions do
  differ).
- **Analysis:** `is_dirty` = `has_structural_changes() || has_content_changes()`
  — neither accounts for outputs / execution_count having changed since load.
  The external-change handler (`handle_external_change`) auto-reloads when not
  dirty. Relates to phase 14 (save-conflict) and phase 9 (reload).
- **Fix attempted (2026-07-11):** new `execution_state_changed` flag on the
  notebook, OR'd into `Item::is_dirty`. Set whenever execution state mutates:
  submitting/queueing a run, kernel messages routed to a cell (outputs /
  counts), clear-cell-outputs, clear-all-outputs, and the restart counter
  reset. Cleared by `mark_as_saved` (save persists the state) and
  `reload_cells_from_notebook` (state now matches disk). Result: an
  executed-but-unedited notebook counts as dirty → an external save now shows
  the conflict toast instead of silently auto-reloading over the run results,
  and the tab dirty-dot/save-prompt reflect execution state too.
- **Refined (same day, from self-review before user testing):** (1) the flag
  is only set for kernel messages that change savable content (stream/display/
  result/input/error) — Status busy/idle broadcasts no longer re-dirty a
  just-saved notebook; (2) new `last_saved_disk_text` records exactly what we
  last wrote/loaded, and `handle_external_change` recognizes our OWN save by
  comparing against it BEFORE the dirty check — otherwise saving during a
  long-running cell (outputs arriving between the write and the file-watcher
  event) raised a spurious conflict toast for our own save.
- **Tested:** no — needs user confirmation

## 19. Reloading doesn't clear the conflict notification toast

- **Status:** fix attempted - untested
- **Symptom:** (user 2026-07-11) After the "notebook changed on disk but you
  have unsaved changes" toast appears, reloading via the COMMAND PALETTE
  leaves the toast sitting in the corner. (Clarified: the toast's own Reload
  button DOES clear it — clicking a toast action auto-dismisses that toast —
  only reloads from outside the toast leave it up.) Any reload of that file
  should dismiss the toast, since the conflict is resolved.
- **Analysis:** the toast is shown via `workspace.show_toast` with a
  `NotificationId` (`NotebookConflictToast`); nothing dismissed it on reload.
- **Fix attempted (2026-07-11):** `reload_cells_from_notebook` — the shared
  sink for every reload path (command palette, toast button, external-change
  auto-reload) — now calls `workspace.dismiss_toast` for the conflict toast id
  (the marker type was hoisted to module scope so show and dismiss share it).
- **Tested:** no — needs user confirmation
